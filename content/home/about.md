# About me

I received my BS of Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I currently work with Prof. [Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io/) in [Vision Science Lab] (http://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html) (Co-supervised with [Dr. Ming-Yu, Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y-f-MZgAAAAJ&hl=en)). Previously, I was interested machine learning application in vision and language. In particular, I am interested in natural language generation and how to learn disentangled representation of natural language. Recently, my main interest shift to machine learning application and techniques in molecular data.  More details, please see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZ_z1apURHfzesbXyn411w9pl2i8gmbw/view?usp=sharing). I also have a [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/kuanchen). I am looking for Ph.D. start from 2019 Fall or any research internship start from 2019 Winter/Spring.
