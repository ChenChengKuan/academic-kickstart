# About me

I received my BS of Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I currently work with Prof. [Shou-De,Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sdlin/) in Machine Discovery and Social Mining Lab and Prof. [Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io/) in [Vision Science Lab](http://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html). My current research interests are visual and language understanding, cross-modality representation and reinforcement learning. Also, I had some exepriences about applying deep learning to malicious software detection in industry. In 2013, I spent a wonderful year as visiting student in [CentraleSupelec](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/), Paris, France.
