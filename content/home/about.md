# About me

I received my BS of Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I currently work with Prof. [Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io/) in [Vision Science Lab] (http://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html) (Co-supervised with [Dr. Ming-Yu, Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y-f-MZgAAAAJ&hl=en)). I have broad interests in vision and language. In particular, I am interested in natural language generation and how to learn disentangled representation of natural language.  Besides, I had some experiences about applying deep learning to malicious software detection in industry. In 2013, I spent a wonderful year as a visiting student in [CentraleSupelec](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/), Paris, France. More details, please see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HFxA-JOIq_2AS_xBRt2o15-htEm62FBv). I also have a [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/kuanchen). I am looking for Ph.D. start from 2019 Fall or any research internship start from 2019 Winter/Spring.
