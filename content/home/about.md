# About me

I am MSc student in Computer Science at Columbia University. Currently, I am working on aplpying machine learning to computational patholody under the suprvision of Dr. [Faisl Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/) in Harvard Medical School. Previously, I was fortunate enought to work with Prof. [Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io/) in [Vision Science Lab](http://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html) (Co-supervised with [Dr. Ming-Yu, Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y-f-MZgAAAAJ&hl=en)) where I conducted research about computer vision and natural language. Please refer to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Adqgr0xrnUGBMLgfIbudUD0ROVB0903c/view?usp=sharing) for more details.

I am looking for 2021 PhD opportunities.
