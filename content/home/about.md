# About me

I received my BS of Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I currently work with Prof. [Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io/) in [Vision Science Lab] (http://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html) (Co-supervised with [Dr. Ming-Yu, Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y-f-MZgAAAAJ&hl=en)). I have broad interests of vision and language. In particular, I am interested in natural language generation and how to learn disentangled respresentation of natural language.  In additoin, I had some experiences about applying deep learning to malicious software detection in industry. In 2013, I spent a wonderful year as visiting student in [CentraleSupelec](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/), Paris, France. More details please see my CV(coming soon). I also have a [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/kuanchen)
